Duplicator
===========

(Work in progress....)

A small [Sketch 3](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) plugin that takes the currently selected layers and copies them once or multiple times in a specified direction. A must have tool for any UI/UX designer's tool belt who uses Sketch on a daily basis! :)

Here is a short screencast that demonstrates all the features of the plugin:

3. Copy downloaded zip file to the revealed folder and un-zip it.

4. Rename the extracted folder to "Duplicate"

5. You're ready to start! :)

## Usage

### Instant Cheatsheet
I prefer to use keyboard shortcuts whenever possible, but I'm really bad at remembering them. A few years ago I found out that in order to remember them quickly it's very helpful to have a small cheat sheet that contains all the keyboard shortcuts right in front of my eyes while learning a new tool.

Since this plugin is totally useless without shortcuts I decided to built it in right into the plugin itself! This cheat sheet is just a plugin that embeds raster image containing shortcut reference into your current page.

##### In order to see the cheat sheet, just run "Cheatsheet" plugin from the plugins menu:

   ![Paste Cheatsheet](http://turbobabr.github.io/duplicator/images/paste-cheatsheet.png)

##### It will automatically embed the cheat sheet into your current page as a new artboard:

### Step and Repeat

1. Select one or more layers you want to duplicate multiple times
2. Step and repeat selection with custom spacing:
