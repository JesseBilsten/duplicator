Duplicator
===========

(Work in progress....)

A small Sketch plugin that takes the currently selected layers and copies them once or multiple times in a specified direction. A must have tool for any UI/UX designer's tool belt! :)

## Installation

1. Download (...).

2. Reveal plugins folder in finder ('Sketch App Menu' -> 'Plugins' -> 'Reveal Plugins Folder...').

3. Copy (...) file to the folder and un-zip it.

## Usage

### Instant Cheatsheet
I prefer to use keyboard shortcuts whenever possible, but I'm really bad at remembering them. A few years ago I found out that in order to remember them quickly it's very helpful to have a small cheat sheet that contains all the keyboard shortcuts right in front of my eyes while learning a new tool.

Since this plugin is totally useless without shortcuts I decided to built it in right into the plugin itself! This cheat sheet is just a plugin that embeds raster image containing shortcut reference into your current page.

###### In order to see the cheat sheet, just run "Cheatsheet" plugin from the plugins menu:

![Paste Cheatsheet](http://turbobabr.github.io/duplicator/images/paste-cheatsheet.png)

###### It will automatically embed the cheat sheet into your current page as a new artboard:
